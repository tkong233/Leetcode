# Practice Diary
## Feb 27, 2020

Today I start to write mini diaries about my progress, mood and struggles while practicing algorithm questions. Hope to track down my growth and mental states for the older me to look back on.

Working on simple but important DFS questions. Still a bit confused about how recursion works but can write working solutions. Why need to detele the last char? Really need to figure this out. It's driving me crazy.

Finally picked up the practice. Finished Find Coins Combination, another DFS question. Start to understand DFS better. Should keep practicing and review past questions.

Totally forgot about this diary... So I've been making slow yet somewhat consistent progress. Consistency is the gold, but should push myself a bit harder. This quarantine period is actually a gift for practicing leetcode. Should make good use of the time. (Though it's so easy to loose motivation staying at home every day)
