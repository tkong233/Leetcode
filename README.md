# Practice Diary
## Feb 27, 2020
Today I start to write mini diaries about my progress, mood and struggles while practicing algorithm questions. Hope to track down my growth and mental states for the older me to look back on.

Working on simple but important DFS questions. Still a bit confused about how recursion works but can write working solutions. Why need to detele the last char? Really need to figure this out. It's driving me crazy.
