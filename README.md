# Practice Diary
## Feb 27, 2020

Today I start to write mini diaries about my progress, mood and struggles while practicing algorithm questions. Hope to track down my growth and mental states for the older me to look back on.

Working on simple but important DFS questions. Still a bit confused about how recursion works but can write working solutions. Why need to detele the last char? Really need to figure this out. It's driving me crazy.

Finally picked up the practice. Finished Find Coins Combination, another DFS question. Start to understand DFS better. Should keep practicing and review past questions. 

Due to COVID-19, my university is closed and will move to distance learning shortly. It's a pitty that my last semester is ended in this abrupted way. No prom, no senior recital, no good-byes to many close friends. Despite the sentimental circumstance, I need to put together my mood and keep up the hard work, because I'll start job-hunting soon after grad school starts. At least I get to stay with my beloved. Luck in misfortune.
